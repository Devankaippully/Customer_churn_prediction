# Customer_churn_prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. We employ various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to identify customers likely to leave the bank. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation steps. Our analysis provides insights into key factors influencing customer churn and offers a comparative study of different machine learning models' effectiveness in predicting churn.

Future work includes implementing advanced ensemble methods, exploring deep learning models, and developing a more sophisticated feature engineering process. This project serves as a foundation for banks to proactively address customer retention and enhance their services based on data-driven insights.
